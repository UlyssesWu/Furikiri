# Furikiri

Furikiri (FreeKiri / [フリキリ](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA#OVA) / 福里吉里) is a managed TJS2 disassembler/decompiler.

Furikiri is currently in development. The disassembler works well but the decompiler is NOT ready for use. Pull request is welcomed.

The following softwares/projects are parts of Furikiri.

## Girigiri (Furikiri.CLI)

Girigiri ([ギリギリ](https://youtu.be/dQLG0lwe_RM)) is the front-end (console) of Furikiri. 

It's a managed TJS2 bytecode disassembler/decompiler which does not require kirikiri engine (e.g. KRKR 2/Z/#) to run.
